- Query Gaia survey selection functions for the probabilities that sources of given properties are included in the Gaia catalog.
- (maybe) Construct a custom subsample selection function by specifying the conditions in terms of Gaia variables, and combine it with the survey selection functions.
- Query ready-made Gaia DR3 subsample selection functions for
	- the astrometry sample
	- the RVS sample
